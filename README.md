A bad physics simulation or engine??? idk.

This is a project created at first to implement concepts I learn from my AP Physics C: Mechanics class (probably should've used a game engine instead of doing it from scratch)
and a way to satisfy my impulse to build something. As I was researching, I lost track of my goal and decided that I wanted to build something like Box2D. I quickly got overwhelmed by the complexity and settled for something more of a simulation regarding bouncing balls.

Inspirations and ideas - JBox2D, YouTube, forums, and online articles.

Features implemented:
- Java GUI
- Game Loop Control
- Collision Detection
- Collision Response
- Vector Math

Plans for when I return:
- A system that allows for easy creation of new shapes and environments.
- More accurate calculations.
