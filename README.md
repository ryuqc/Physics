A bad physics simulation or engine??? idk.

This is a project created at first to implement concepts I learn from my AP Physics C: Mechanics class (probably should've used a game engine instead of doing it from scratch)
and a way to satisfy my impulse to build something.

Inspirations and ideas - JBox2D, YouTube, forums, and online articles.

Features implemented:
- GUI
- Game Loop Control
- Collision Detection
- Collision Response
- Vector Math
